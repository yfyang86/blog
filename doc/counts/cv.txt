Worked extensions of Cox-Model with non-proportional hazards.
o	Developed a high performance R package using R/C++ and openMP/R parallel to implement and compared several extensions of proportional hazard model.
o	Performed optimization algorithms such as Newton-Raphson, interior point method and iterative convex minorant to existing models and evaluated the model/algorithm performance.
